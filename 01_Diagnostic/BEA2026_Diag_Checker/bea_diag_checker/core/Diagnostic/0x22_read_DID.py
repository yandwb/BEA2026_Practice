"""UDS Read Data By Identifier service (0x22).

The service receives a two-byte DID such as ``0xF180`` and sends the UDS
request ``22 F1 80`` through :class:`SerialManager`.  The serial manager wraps
that request with the configured BEA start and end frame markers. The serial
reader keeps receiving asynchronously, so the device response is reported by
the normal RX logging path rather than being returned synchronously from this
function.
